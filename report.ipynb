        "The problem that will be tackled in this project is Feature Selection. The goal is to obtain the subset of available features in a dataset that improves model performance by increasing its accuracy and decreasing its error rate. With the presence of irrelevant features in the dataset, more processing and memory requirements are necessary, thus wasting computing resources. To better understand the possible impacts of feature selection, we could cite the following pros: \n",

        "- Reducing Overfitting\n",
        "- Improving the model Accuracy\n",
        "- Reducing Training Time\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature Selection may be done manually or automatically. Some manual techniques include univariate selection, feature importance, and the correlation matrix. The objective of the Univariate selection method is to statistically describe the relationship between each feature and the target. Also, feature importance generates a score for each feature to rank it. For instance, Decision Tree algorithms may rank features according to Gini impurity tests. Finally, the Correlation Matrix shows the correlation between pairs of features so that the features with a high correlation could be removed. The literature presents the usage of optimization techniques to automatically find the best (or a quite good) subset of features. Some of the methods include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- <b>Exhaustive search</b>\n",
        "- <b>Simulated Annealing</b>\n",
        "- <b>Transformation Graph</b>\n",
        "- <b>Genetic Algorithms</b>\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>Exhaustive Search</b> is not an optimization technique, but it is worth to be mentioned as its computational complexity is $O(2^n)$. This technique tries every possible subset of features to find the best one. Due to its computational complexity, this technique is not practical in most cases. <b>Simulated Annealing</b> is a metaheuristic for complex nonlinear optimization problems and is analogous to the simulation of the annealing of solids. The analogy pairs are as follows: feasible solution (state), cost (energy), optimal solution (ground state), local search (rapid quenching), simulated annealing (careful annealing). On the other hand, <b>Transformation Graph</b> is a strategy that utilizes a tree-like structure to generate possible solutions. First, $n$ solutions are generated by removing at each one distinct feature. Second, all the solutions are evaluated. Third, the best solution is chosen and $n-1$ is generated by removing each feature yet not removed. That strategy goes on considering a budget. The issue of this strategy is that it requires a substantial amount of memory. Finally, <b>Genetic Algorithm</b> is inspired by genetics (DNA) to search through solutions. Its process can be described with the following steps: (1) it generates a population considering variations of the DNA, (2) then ranks the population according to some score, it applies some forms of mutations and other transformations to the DNA at each generation, and finally, (3) it iterates through the previous steps until it reaches a stopping rule. The stopping rule may be the number of generations produced or a target solution was reached. \n",

The selection may help a data scientist to analyze data and improve the efficiency of machine learning models. To evaluate the GA strategy and each member of the population a supervised learning model was chosen. The model has a <i>target</i> that is the feature of the dataset to be predicted. Supervised learning models may be divided into two groups: Classification, comprehends the prediction of a categorical feature (class); and Regression, comprehends the prediction of a number value that does not describe a category. In this work, tabular classification datasets were obtained as there is a huge amount of them available openly. Also, there are well known pre-processing techniques that are easy to use. An example of a dataset may require to classify mushrooms according to their characteristics, so each type of mushroom comprehends a distinct class. With the datasets and model, GA parameters may be changed so that we obtain the best parameters to find a good subset of features. To summarize, the methodology comprehends the presentation of some data characteristics, datasets, classification model, parameters and configurations (group of parameters) and metrics."

That will help us evaluate the computing resources needed by the genetic algorithm, and its practicality in applying it to the real world.

With that said, Neural Networks, although they usually have a good result, demand a large computing power to train. In the case of Neural Networks a novel area called TinyML may be usefull to improve the competional efficiency of Neural Network models, however is out of the scope in this work. Support Vector Machines also require a large computing power as it tries to map data to high dimensional hiperplanes to separate data into the classes. Two models may be mentioned with a moderate computing power requirement, that are: Decision Tree and Random Forest.

Scenario C5 produces the ‚Äúleast good‚Äù chromosome with a final fitness value of 94%. In fact with a crossover rate of 50%, meaning that creating new generations where the new chromosome is composed 50-50 from the chromosomes of the two parents isn‚Äôt a good strategy. If any slight increase in fitness value is important, then C3 produces the best chromosome, among the best chromosomes from all the scenarios, with a fitness value of about 94.5% starting at generation 65. The strategy of taking 80% of the gene sequence from the best parent and 20% from the other parent to produce the new chromosome was the best one. Some specific features contained in the best parent explain mostly the classification of the target. We also note here the impact of randomness on the results. In fact, C0 and C2 have the same strategy as C3, the differences in the fitness values having nothing to do in the creation of new generations, but to do with the randomness in the mutation and crossover processes.

For this reason, it wasn‚Äôt possible to show the results for the Human Activity Classification dataset, its total number of features being above 500. We should also add that the decision tree model is relatively fast to train. Combining the genetic algorithm with other artificial intelligence models such as neural networks would require simulation time of much higher magnitude.\n",

Thus, it‚Äôs not possible to select which scenario specifically is the best one for all the datasets. There isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù scenario. In addition, due to the randomness of the mutation and crossover processes, we recommend running the genetic algorithm a couple of times in order to get the best feature selection in terms of fitness value. \n",

It‚Äôs important to point out that the limited results aren‚Äôt due to the genetic algorithm but related to the choice of the decision tree model or to the choice of features selected. Therefore, the strategy in this case might be to explore other possible features that might impact in some ways the target to classify. If that option was already explored then we can conclude that the decision tree classification model might not be the best machine learning technique for the problem at hand. Thus, they can save time and try a more complex classification technique such as k-clustering, SVM, or neural networks for example. \n"

        "\n",
        "As we can see from this project, combining a machine learning method with  the genetic algorithm in order to find the best combinations of features, from all the features available in a dataset, can be an interesting strategy. \n",
        "The genetic algorithm is very efficient at selecting, combining and trying various subsets of features in order to improve the fitness value and build the best classification model.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the vast majority of the datasets in our project, simply feeding all the features to the decision tree model produces limited results. The genetic algorithm is able to select the most appropriate features with the end goal of improving the fitness value of the machine learning model. In our case, the fitness value is the F1 score, but the algorithm can be easily adapted to cater to any other fitness function, or to another modeling problem such as regression. \n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, due to \"the curse of dimensionality\", the more we include features in the datasets, the more we need observations for model building and the higher the dataset size in terms of memory size. This has a significant impact on the execution time for the genetic algorithm. However, we should temper that fact by remembering that we need to execute the genetic algorithm only once for feature selection. On another note, we could improve the stop criterion of the genetic algorithm to make it stop earlier when, after a reasonable amount of iterations, we see no improvement in the fitness value.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the decision tree model is relatively easy and fast to build. If someone isn't sure which machine learning model to use, then the algorithm of this project might give them an answer whether the decision tree model is appropriate to the datasets and the problem at hand. If the fitness values found are limited, then either the features selected aren't adequate, and someone might want to collect other features, or they might select a more complex machine learning model.\n",
